# Paint
Project for CIS120 @ Upenn Engineering: Designed a Microsoft Paint imitation application for my that received a perfect score. Created as Object Oriented Design in OCaml. Used a GUI to interface with the user where the user was able to draw, erase, color, select width of lines, choose shape, undo, and save for later use.
